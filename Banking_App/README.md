## Banking App Info:

This project uses vectors to create bank accounts, where each account possesses features like account name, account number, PIN number, and total balance.

After creating a single (or multiple) account(s), the program becomes a bank console machine (or a different sort of ATM), 
where the user is prompted to enter one's account number.<br>
If the account number is present in the bank's account number(s), then the user is prompted for PIN, **where the PIN is allowed to be entered 
for *maximum 3 times***.
After 3 attempts, the program will prompt `Security error!!!` and again ask for the account number.

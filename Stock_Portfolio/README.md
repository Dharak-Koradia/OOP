### Stock portfolio Info:

Stock portfolio holds up to **10** stocks of a person, and it lets the user calculate the potential profit/loss of the shares owned by the individual.<br> 
Considering that the portfolio will be mostly used by a regular person, the owned stock shares are limited to be 10 in the portfolio, but the limit can be changed by simply changing the value in the `if` statement in the `addStock` function. <br><br>

If you would like this portfolio to be a **20** stocks holder, then please change the limit in the first `if` statement of `addStock` function to be `if vect.size() < 20`, and you will be able to see potential profit/loss of 20 different stocks.
